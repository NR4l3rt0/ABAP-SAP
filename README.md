This repo summarizes the little project made for the company. 

In simple terms, the program begins in the initial screen where the user can either update a field in a register
or select a type of contract.

In the first case, when a specific button is pushed, a connection with another program is made.

In the second option, as I had to do the renting one. After choosing the contract, the user will be brought to a 
second screen where a form and a table can be filled.  
There, search helps and extra info with pop-up windows will support the user in the process.

When the form is finished, it will receive the appropriate info based on the answers (the messages are there because
the program is still in development/testing).

In the background, all the logic required applies.


On the other hand, a background job has also been released to create a file periodically in an application server.
